    <h2>About Gryphon ESP</h2>
    <p>GryphonESP provides a large variety of services for the oil and gas industry.
We have a focus in safety, especially in remote areas where local first responders are not nearby or where it may take an extended time for them to get to location, the 24/7 presence of our trained first responders is invaluable for helping to prevent loss of life and property in medical or fire emergencies. We also provide rescue teams for confined space entry, H2S equipment and general safety training. In addition, we provide training for compliance with company, local or national standards to help you maintain a higher level of safety at your work site. GryphonESP provides a safety net to assist your operations by allowing the workers on your locations to remain focused on their jobs, and not ours. By using GryphonESP, you can reduce the likelihood and consequences of incidents and increase the profitability of your assets while improving safety for the local community and your employees.</p>
